======

These icons are based (mostly copied or mixed) in the projects of others. From here I thank them for their work.

Thanks to Haiku OS project.

Thanks to 'Meanwhile' for its beautiful icons. Please continue your work and release it as open source!

Also thanks to all those unknown authors who have not saved any reference and, therefore, I can not specifically mention. Thanks to all of them.

If you find an icon (or part thereof) containing material protected so it can not be distributed as GPL, please let me know and definitely erase.

Thanks you guys!
