>>  General notes:

This is a collection of icons for 31 BeOS applications. 
Included are the 22 icons from v2.0, several of which have been further improved in v3.1 (in almost all cases concerning the 16x16 pixel versions). They are: Beezer, BePDF, BeShare, BeTeX, CL-Amp, Firefox, FlipSide A.E., Nvu, Thunderbird, VLC and XRS icons.


>> Installing the icons:

> Two remarks first:

1) Please note: icons previously unzipped in another OS and later brought to BeOS will probably have lost their included 16x16 versions!
2) The replacement procedure has to be used for each individual icon, so you'll have to repeat it as often as there are icons you want to replace. It's a clear, convenient and quick routine though...

> ...and it goes like this:

+ Unzip the file called BBIv-3.1.zip that contains all the replacement icons. (If what you now see doesn't resemble the screenshot from BeBits, you're probably using a Tracker variety whose way of displaying images causes this. The icons are still as you'd expect though, which will become clear as soon as you simply continue the replacement procedure below) 

+ Search for the application whose icon you want to replace. You'd best replace the application's icon and then create a new (Desktop)link to it, instead of limiting the change only to the application's link-icon.   

+ Right-click on the selected icon, choose Add-Ons, then FileType. In the top-right corner of the window that appeared, you should see the icon you want to replace. Leave the window open.

+ From the unzipped icons, right-click on the matching replacement icon and again choose Add-Ons, then FileType. It's easiest to place the window that appeared next to the window you still had left open.
 
+ Drag and drop the replacement icon from its window's topright corner to the other window's topright corner.
 
+ In the window that now has the new icon, choose File, Save.
 
+ Close both windows to complete the operation and start again at the second '+' above for the next icon replacement.


>> Development:

I would like to see this as a project and create/add more icons in the future. 
One of the ways to do this could be to accept proposals from developers who are unhappy with their application's present icon (See the Be-beautified Icons page on BeBits for the weblink to the details and conditions).
Trying to select improvable icons from BeBits' 'most popular/best rated apps' category rankings led up to the v2.0 collection, while having a look at apps deemed worthy by others to include in CD's/downloads that go with Haiku mainly inspired this v3.1 selection.

To the developers that see their application's icon being adapted in this collection: BBI isn't meant as a (personal) attack on your artistic abilities! 
The goal is to make icons fit in as good as possible with the existing original BeOS icon concepts regarding looks and structure, which are so clear that it makes doing so a rather neutral act. 
I'm sure the main reason for this collection to have taken shape is just that somebody decided to spend many eye-straining hours on it, which is obviously bound to lead to a more perfected end result.

Any questions or comments you might have are perhaps best posted at the Be-beautified icons download page on BeBits -by making use of the site's Talkback feature.
